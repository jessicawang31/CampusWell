## Problem Space
The significance of accessible health resources is crucial, particularly for college students navigating independence for the first time. Many students are uncertain of where to find necessary health resources to protect their health and well-being. Being sick not only affects their health, but also could affect academic performance and overall well-being. Addressing this concern is essential for fostering a healthy college experience.

An information technology problem in the space of UW is the lack of accessible, navigable health platforms that provide detailed information about available resources on or near campus. These issues could include problems such as real-time appointment availability for urgent care, clarity about insurance coverage vs. out-of-pocket payment options, or more filtered options based on the students health concerns. Students who dont have prior experiences navigating health resources may find it challenging to seek for such support, consequently, this could negatively impact their health further if assistance isnt received in a timely manner.

MyUW has links to a few resources for student well-being on their Husky experience toolkit page. According to the website, the page aims to make the most out of their “Husky Experience”. The page consists of four sections that are supposed to address the interconnected dimensions of the Husky Experience: Know Yourself, Know the World, Make Your Way, and Weave it Together. The know yourself section has a list of links to pages that relate to individual student success and well-being. The relevant links include: “Eating for Better Mood and Energy”, “A Little Stress is Good. Really.”, “No Time to be Healthy?”

The University of Washington's Well-Being for Life & Learning initiative, accessible at https://wellbeing.uw.edu, is a comprehensive resource dedicated to supporting the holistic well-being of its students. This web app is designed to inform students about academic performance, personal development, and overall health by providing accessible, tailored well-being resources and services. The platform addresses several core areas of student life, including mental health, physical wellness, social connections, and academic success. Key features of the site include Mental Health Resources, Physical Health Guides, and Social Well-Being. Tools and services to aid in academic advising, career planning, and skill development are also provided. The web app aims to empower students to thrive in all aspects of their university experience by integrating well-being into the fabric of campus life.

## Our Application and Features
The main users of this application are UW students. This may impact minority groups positively as it provides equal access to information regarding nearby resources. However groups that have limited access to technology may find it difficult to utilize this app.

The users will be able to search for health resources through our web app and see a history of their previous visits.

*Search feature:*

One of the main interactive features the website provides is a search function. The user can easily search for various resources within their location such as clinics and more. The search bar offers deeper interactivity with the ability to pin locations on the map, filtering by availability and needs, and sorting from closest to furthest.

*History tracker and well-being:*

Another main feature of our web-app will be a tracker of all previous visits the user has had. It will keep track of the date, time, location, type of service they received during that appointment. Additionally, there will be a section that prompts the user to add comments about how they were feeling during the visit and how they feel after as a way to track and express their emotional well-being.

We intend to use Google Maps API as an external source. The users will be able to view precise locations of these resources such as health clinics or pharmacies. This API also offers route directions and ETAs to said specific location, operating hours, and contact information for that specific location. We hope to also implement maybe services that location offers and payment information as well.

Our proposed web app solution will be geared to all UW students (new and current) to provide them with available resources for their general well being and health. This includes nutrition, physical activity, study habits, social well-being, and mental health. One of the goals of our app is to ensure the content of the web application is engaging for our users in order for them to actually apply these resources in real life. To enhance user engagement, we intend to integrate interactive features and personalized content tailored to individual user profiles. Unique features such as progress tracking mechanisms will be implemented to not only inform but also actively involve users in meeting their wellness goals. Furthermore, our commitment to accessibility and inclusivity ensures that all students, regardless of background or ability, have equal opportunity to benefit from our app. By continuously adapting our web app through user feedback, our app aims to evolve, ensuring its relevance and effectiveness in promoting a healthier, more balanced student lifestyle.
